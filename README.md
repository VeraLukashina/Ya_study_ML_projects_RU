# Carsharing Vehicle Accident Risk Assessment System

This project aims to explore the feasibility of predicting car accidents based on historical data from a specific region. The client is a carsharing company.

The goal of the project is to develop a model capable of assessing the risk of an accident on a selected route. Risk is defined as the probability of an accident causing any vehicle damage. Once a driver books a car  and selects a route, the system will evaluate the risk level. If the risk is high, the driver will receive a warning and route recommendations.
