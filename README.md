# Age Prediction Using Computer Vision

This project aims to develop a computer vision system to estimate the approximate age of customers based on their photos taken in a retail environment. 

The goal of the project is to build and train a neural network model that reliably predicts customer age.


# Carsharing Vehicle Accident Risk Assessment System

This project aims to explore the feasibility of predicting car accidents based on historical data from a specific region. The client is a carsharing company.

The goal of the project is to develop a model capable of assessing the risk of an accident on a selected route. Risk is defined as the probability of an accident causing any vehicle damage. Once a driver books a car  and selects a route, the system will evaluate the risk level. If the risk is high, the driver will receive a warning and route recommendations.


# Hourly Taxi Demand Forecasting at Airports

This project aims to forecast the hourly number of taxi orders at airports based on historical order data analysis.

The goal of the project is to develop a model capable of predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour.


# Toxic Comment Detection

This project aims to detect toxic comments in user-generated edits to product descriptions. 

The goal of the project is to develop a model capable of classifying comments as toxic or neutral, achieving an F1 score of at least 0.75.
